			<center><H1> Coding the Past Project History</H1></center>For our part of coding the past project in history, we were assigned three main components. The first thing we had to do was pick a person to interview. The person I decided to interview was my mom. The reason why I chose my mom was because I knew she would have a lot of things to say about her past. After interviewing her, we had to type of the interview. Along with the typed up interview we had to highlight it, with specific colors that meant something. In our interview, our interviewee had mentioned certain places throughout. With those places mentioned we had to do a scribble map. The scribble map marked the different places and had a description of the event that happened.

			<br><br> <center><H1>Essay</h1></center>For my essay I had to chosen one thing from our interview that was mentioned. We could have chosen anything as long as it was said. My mom in the interview mentioned migrating to the US from Mexico, so I decided to do it on Immigration and DACA.  The main point of my essay was to show how not all immigrants are bad as the new makes them seem. Also how some came to the US without a chose and are being thrown out after being promised a chance to stay with DACA. For DACA I mentioned when it was made and why many are being affected by it being taken away. Throughout I put people’s own personal story, so the reader could feel what I was trying to say. For example in my essay I put “...“This is because my immigrant story is tied to so much loss and despair….pain and anguish that has yet to heal 30 years later”(Bahareh). The pain that he is still feeling is about being torn away from a country that he made his own. It’s not where they come from that defines them as a human being, it's how they are on the inside that matters. Everyone has a different reason for migrating to the United States. Some didn’t even have a chose to come to the United states.”
