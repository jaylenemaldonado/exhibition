			For our part of coding the past project in history, we were assigned three main components. The first thing we had to do was pick a person to interview. The person I decided to interview was my mom. The reason why I chose my mom was because I knew she would have a lot of things to say about her past. After interviewing her, we had to type of the interview. Along with the typed up interview we had to highlight it, with specific colors that meant something. In our interview, our interviewee had mentioned certain places throughout. With those places mentioned we had to do a scribble map. The scribble map marked the different places and had a description of the event that happened.

			<br><br> <center> <H1> 3D Sketch </h1> </center> 
				For our 3d sketch we decided to do a locomotive. The reason why we decided to do locomotive is because we had steelmaking which we couldnâ€™t promote as a product, so we chose locomotives since they are also made out of steel. We specifically chose locomotives because during the industrial revolution locomotives helped transport goods,people, ect, so we thought it would be best to sell. My partner was inspired by a image he saw and decided to make it his own.

			<br><br> <center> <H1> 3D Model </h1> </center> 
				Since our 3D sketch was a locomotive, then we had to make our 3D model a locomotive as well. We made our model out of household items like popsicle sticks,soda can, water bottle caps and cardboard. We also decided to give our model train tracks as well since those are also made out of steel.

				To be able to sell our product we had to be prepared. We had to a slides presentation talking about our company name which is Indasteel. Then we had to talk about the significance our product had in the industrial revolution.  In our slides we showed the audience the research we did, other inventions during the industrial revolution that were made out of steel, and lastly why they should by our product.Then we had to make sure each person in  our group had to slides to talk about.
