				For our part in the coding the past in Noel’s class we had three main assignments. The first one we did was our subject self-portrait. For this we had to use the interview in Daramola's class. Taking things from the interview and put them into one thing. I included pictures of things  that my subject mentioned and put them into my work. He next part of our project we had to do a reflection. We had to be able to explain our reasoning on some of the things we included. Like why we put certain aspects into our work. For the next part of the project we had to use the interview from history and create an essay. We had to take one piece that our subject talked about and turn it into an essay. We could’ve chosen anything we wanted as long as it was mentioned in the interview.

			<br><br> <center> <H1> Child Labor Collage</h1> </center> Some of the images I chose I decided to put into my Layered Subject Portrait were related to what my mom said or things she likes.For example the historical moment she talked about in our interview was about the LA riots. She described what she remembered during that time. Specifically she talked about a group of people stealing from a payless store, so I put a picture people stealing from a payless store. Another thing I decided to include in my portrait is where she was born which is Michoacan,Mexico and Iput pictures of the place. Lastly I decided to include hints of purple because it’s her favorite color and I knew it would make it pop. As I mentioned before I decided to include pictures from the LA Riots, more specifically pictures of building on fire, people stealings,rodney king, and police officers. This connected to what my mom said in her interview because she talked about seeing stores on fire and how the LA riots started with Rodney and the cops. One specific picture I decided to put that she talked about was people stealing from a payless and surprisingly I found a picture of that what she described.

			<br> <br> <center> <H1> Social Media </h1> <center> For our reflection we had back up our decisions as to why we put certain thing in our portrait. In my reflection I mentioned”The pictures that I decided to be more dominant were the ones that she mentioned the most and I knew meant the most to her.  For example I put pictures of Michoacan,mexico because it represent where she came from. Also the LA Riot pictures because it was the historical moment she talked about.. The smaller pictures meant that she liked but weren't the most important. For example the picture of the butterfly,Jenni Rivera, and US flag, it was still connected to her but didn’t mean as much.” We also had to do the reflection in MLA format. Being able to backup our choices is what Noel was mostly grading us on because everyone would have something different.

			<br><br> <center> <H1> Essay </h1> </center> For my essay I had to chosen one thing from our interview that was mentioned. We could have chosen anything as long as it was said. My mom in the interview mentioned migrating to the US from Mexico, so I decided to do it on Immigration and DACA.  The main point of my essay was to show how not all immigrants are bad as the new makes them seem. Also how some came to the US without a chose and are being thrown out after being promised a chance to stay with DACA. For DACA I mentioned when it was made and why many are being affected by it being taken away. Throughout I put people’s own personal story, so the reader could feel what I was trying to say. For example in my essay I put “...“This is because my immigrant story is tied to so much loss and despair….pain and anguish that has yet to heal 30 years later”(Bahareh). The pain that he is still feeling is about being torn away from a country that he made his own. It’s not where they come from that defines them as a human being, it's how they are on the inside that matters. Everyone has a different reason for migrating to the United States. Some didn’t even have a chose to come to the United states.”</div>
