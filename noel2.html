				For our part of A Timely Solution in Humanities, we were assigned a couple main components. The first part being that we had to pick a picture that was during the industrial revolution, so we could base our poem on it.  We made our poem, after that, we had to a collage that represented our poem or that was inspired by our poem. After finishing those parts we had to do an artist statement that explained why we chose certain things to go in our poem and art. The second main component was doing a poem that was inspired by social media and another topic. I chose social media and politics. We did the same steps as the first one to complete the second part.

			For our social media collage we had to pick one main topic to base our poem and art piece to. The topic I chose was social media and politics. Along with our topic we had to do research with two different sources. After doing research we had to start doiong our poem.
