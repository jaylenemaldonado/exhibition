			<center><H1>Welcome to my Coding the Past Project</H1></center>
				For this project we had to focus on the past. In World History we had to interview the person of our choice. We had to ask them questions about the history when they were growing up. I interviewed my mom, one main things we talked about was her migrating to US and LA Riots. In English we had to make a subject portrait with pictures that represented them and somethings they talked about in the interview. After finishing our subject self protrait we had to do a flection analyzing certain aspects of our portait. After finishing our project we moved on to another part that we had to which was an essay. For our essay we had the ablity to write about anything as long as our subject said it in my interview. The topic I decided to talk immigration and why people shouldn't judge them by what they hear in the news. Now that I have finished all the projects you will be able to see everything thingthat I have mentioned. I hope you enjoy!

			For our part in the coding the past in Noel’s class we had three main assignments. The first one we did was our subject self-portrait. For this we had to use the interview in Daramola's class. Taking things from the interview and put them into one thing. I included pictures of things  that my subject mentioned and put them into my work. He next part of our project we had to do a reflection. We had to be able to explain our reasoning on some of the things we included. Like why we [put certain aspects into our work. For the next part of the project we had to use the interview from history and create an essay. We had to take one piece that our subject talked about and turn it into an essay. We could’ve chosen anything we wanted as long as it was mentioned in the interview.

			For our part of coding the past project in history, we were assigned three main components. The first thing we had to do was pick a person to interview. The person I decided to interview was my mom. The reason why I chose my mom was because I knew she would have a lot of things to say about her past. After interviewing her, we had to type of the interview. Along with the typed up interview we had to highlight it, with specific colors that meant something. In our interview, our interviewee had mentioned certain places throughout. With those places mentioned we had to do a scribble map. The scribble map marked the different places and had a description of the event that happened.

			<br><br> <center><H1>A Timely Solution:History</h1></center>For my essay I had to chosen one thing from our interview that was mentioned. We could have chosen anything as long as it was said. My mom in the interview mentioned migrating to the US from Mexico, so I decided to do it on Immigration and DACA.  The main point of my essay was to show how not all immigrants are bad as the new makes them seem. Also how some came to the US without a chose and are being thrown out after being promised a chance to stay with DACA. For DACA I mentioned when it was made and why many are being affected by it being taken away. Throughout I put people’s own personal story, so the reader could feel what I was trying to say. For example in my essay I put “...“This is because my immigrant story is tied to so much loss and despair….pain and anguish that has yet to heal 30 years later”(Bahareh). The pain that he is still feeling is about being torn away from a country that he made his own. It’s not where they come from that defines them as a human being, it's how they are on the inside that matters. Everyone has a different reason for migrating to the United States. Some didn’t even have a chose to come to the United states.”
