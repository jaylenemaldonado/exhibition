<center><H1>Welcome to my Coding the Past Project</H1></center>
On my website, you will be able to see all my work from the past two projects: coding the past and a timely solution.For our part of in coding the past in history, we had to do interview someone and then transcribe what they said in the interview, plus more which you will see under Coding the past: history. For our part of in coding the past in humanities, we had to do two different collages. One is a self-portrait and the other being our subject portrait which was from our history interviewee. For a timely solution in history, we were assigned an invention from the industrial revolution. We had to research and sell our product. For Humanities we had to a child labor poem and collage to go with it.We also had to a pick a topic to with social media and do a poem and collage.

				For our part in the coding the past in Noel’s class we had three main assignments. The first one we did was our subject self-portrait. For this we had to use the interview in Daramola's class. Taking things from the interview and put them into one thing. I included pictures of things  that my subject mentioned and put them into my work. He next part of our project we had to do a reflection. We had to be able to explain our reasoning on some of the things we included. Like why we [put certain aspects into our work. For the next part of the project we had to use the interview from history and create an essay. We had to take one piece that our subject talked about and turn it into an essay. We could’ve chosen anything we wanted as long as it was mentioned in the interview.

				For our part of coding the past project in history, we were assigned three main components. The first thing we had to do was pick a person to interview. The person I decided to interview was my mom. The reason why I chose my mom was because I knew she would have a lot of things to say about her past. After interviewing her, we had to type of the interview. Along with the typed up interview we had to highlight it, with specific colors that meant something. In our interview, our interviewee had mentioned certain places throughout. With those places mentioned we had to do a scribble map. The scribble map marked the different places and had a description of the event that happened.

				For our part of A Timely Solution in history, we were assigned three main components. The first thing we had to do was be assigned a invention from the Industrial Revolution.We were assigned steelmaking. After being assigned steelmaking then we began looking for research. Since we were steelmaking, we could pick any item that was made out of steel during that time, which we chose locomotives. After picking our main invention we had to do a sketch. After doing our steck we had to build a 3D model based off of our sketch. After building our 3D model we had to sell it by doing presentation slides.

				For our part of A Timely Solution in Humanities, we were assigned a couple main components. The first part being that we had to pick a picture that was during the industrial revolution, so we could base our poem on it.  We made our poem, after that, we had to a collage that represented our poem or that was inspired by our poem. After finishing those parts we had to do an artist statement that explained why we chose certain things to go in our poem and art. The second main component was doing a poem that was inspired by social media and another topic. I chose social media and politics. We did the same steps as the first one to complete the second part.
