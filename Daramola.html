			<center><H1> Coding the Past Project History</H1></center>For our part of coding the past project in history, we were assigned three main components. The first thing we had to do was pick a person to interview. The person I decided to interview was my mom. The reason why I chose my mom was because I knew she would have a lot of things to say about her past. After interviewing her, we had to type of the interview. Along with the typed up interview we had to highlight it, with specific colors that meant something. In our interview, our interviewee had mentioned certain places throughout. With those places mentioned we had to do a scribble map. The scribble map marked the different places and had a description of the event that happened.
